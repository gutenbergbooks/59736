<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Our First National Forest</i></span></h2>
<p>The Shoshone National Forest was set aside by proclamation
of President Benjamin Harrison as the Yellowstone Park Timberland
Reserve on March 30, 1891. It was the first unit of its kind created after
the passage of the Act of March 3, 1891, authorizing the establishment of
forest reserves&mdash;as national forests were then called&mdash;to protect the remaining
timber on the public domain from destruction and to insure a regular
flow of water in the streams. On the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment
of the Shoshone, the national forests embrace approximately
176,000,000 acres of forest land, located in 36 States, Alaska, and Puerto
Rico.</p>
<p>The Shoshone National Forest is situated in the heart of the Absaroka
Mountains, in northwestern Wyoming. It is bounded on the north by
the Montana-Wyoming State line, on the east by the Big Horn Basin,
on the south by the Washakie and Teton Forests, and on the west by the
Yellowstone National Park. It lies almost entirely within Park County;
minor portions extend into Hot Springs and Fremont Counties.</p>
<p>This national forest is the largest of 21 in the Central Rocky Mountain
Region, including within its boundaries 1,592,428 acres, of which all but
26,104 are Federal land. The forest is about 75,000 acres larger than the
State of Delaware. Elevations within the forest range from 4,600 to
13,140 feet, thus providing a wide variation in climate, vegetation, and
wildlife. At the lower elevations the summers are warm and the winters
mild. The higher mountains enjoy only a brief cool summer and are
snowclad most of the year.</p>
<p>Few mountainous sections are more rugged or spectacular. Geologically
the formations are new, and immense areas of exposed rock are broken by
and interspersed with mountain meadows and mantles of unbroken forests.
Those who have packed into the back country, or have driven through
the North Fork of the Shoshone River Canyon, or over the Beartooth
Plateau agree that the variety of scenery and vegetative types is superlative.</p>
<h3 id="c3">ADMINISTRATION FOR PUBLIC USE</h3>
<p>In the administration of national forests the aim is to manage them in
such a way as to make their resources of largest service to the local communities,
the State, and the Nation. This is accomplished by promoting
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the highest social and economic uses of the forests consistent with the
proper use of lands. Such an objective is definitely pointed toward the
maximum sustained yield from all resources.</p>
<p>The national forests are under the administration of the Forest Service,
U. S. Department of Agriculture. Each forest is under the charge of a
forest supervisor. Headquarters of the Shoshone is in Cody, Wyo. Every
forest is divided into districts, each of which is under the supervision of
a district ranger, who has control of all its activities. His responsibilities
include protection of the resources against fire and other enemies, the supervision
of timber sales, and the grazing of large numbers of cattle, sheep,
and horses; the management of wildlife resources; looking after different
permitted uses, such as pastures, summer homes, resorts, power developments;
maintaining forest improvements, including ranger station buildings,
lookout stations, telephone lines, roads, trails, and range improvements;
and providing protection and furnishing information to the thousands
of people who come every year to enjoy vacations in the forest.</p>
<p>The Shoshone National Forest is divided into four ranger districts, as
follows: The Clarks Fork, the Wapiti, the South Fork, and Greybull.
The Greybull is the smallest ranger district, with approximately 300,000
acres. The Clarks Fork is the largest, with about 529,000 acres under the
jurisdiction of the district ranger.</p>
<h3 id="c4">HIGHLIGHTS OF EARLY HISTORY</h3>
<p>Perhaps nothing contributes more to the real enjoyment and to the
fascination of a forest than a knowledge of its early history. Many events
within this area played an important part in the growth and development
of northwestern Wyoming. Many of these are nearly forgotten, and
others are not generally known.</p>
<p>The earliest inhabitants of the forest are believed to have been Indians
known as the &ldquo;Sheepeaters.&rdquo; Just who the &ldquo;Sheepeaters&rdquo; were is not
definitely known. Some historians claim they were an unintellectual
branch of the Snake tribe, others insist that they were renegades and
misfits, driven out of the plains tribes, the Crows, Blackfeet, and Shoshones,
who were forced to the timberclad hills where rough topography
and cover permitted them to evade capture and killing at the hands of
their erstwhile tribal members. They lived in crude tepees constructed
entirely of poles. The &ldquo;Sheepeaters&rdquo; derived their name from the fact
that they preyed extensively on mountain sheep and to some extent on
other species of big game. They trapped their prey in pens or corrals
made of stone.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>The first white men entered Wyoming more than 30 years before the
American Revolution. In 1743, Francois and Louis De La Verendrye,
French-Canadian brothers, traveled through the Rocky Mountain region
to establish branch trading posts. Their home and main post was in
the Great Lakes region. They entered the Big Horn Valley from the
north and traveled up Wood River in the southern part of the forest and
crossed the rugged Continental Divide near the Washakie Needles on their
way into the Wind River country.</p>
<p>Years later, in 1807, John Colter, who startled the world with his
fantastic and unbelievable stories of the natural wonders in Yellowstone
Park, traveled up the Clarks Fork River, after leaving the Lewis and
Clark Expedition on the Missouri. Colter&rsquo;s exact routes of travel are
hotly disputed by historians, but it is well established that he was the
first white man to see the &ldquo;Stinking Water&rdquo; River (the Shoshone), so
named by him because of the foul odors from mineral hot springs along
its banks.</p>
<p>The trail along the Clarks Fork followed by Colter was for generations
a transmountain route of Indian tribes living west of the Continental
Divide which led to the great buffalo country to the east. Among the
tribes using this trail were the Bannocks and Lemhi. After hunting
among the herds in the Big Horn Basin and on the plains east of the Big
Horn Mountains, they returned to their homes heavily laden with meat
and hides. These expeditions frequently led to fiercely fought battles
with the Shoshones and Crows, whose territories were being invaded.</p>
<p>The De La Verendryes and Colter were followed by other &ldquo;mountain
men,&rdquo; equally venturesome, representing the American and Rocky Mountain
fur companies and smaller independent concerns. These hardy, restless,
rugged individuals, including such men as Lisa, Sublette Brothers,
Fraeb, Gervais, and Bridger, were actually the first settlers in what is
now the State of Wyoming, notwithstanding the common belief that the
first settlements in the Territory were in the eastern and southern parts.
These pioneers exploited the country, trapping fur-bearing animals and
trading with the Indians for their take in the pelts.</p>
<p>Following them came the nomadic prospectors and miners, and after
the miners came the first really permanent residents, the cattlemen. The
establishment of the first Stockyards in Kansas City, in 1870, gave impetus
to the expansion of cattle-raising in the West. From 1870 to the 1890&rsquo;s,
this industry grew with unprecedented speed. Charles Carter, in 1879,
trailed in from Oregon the first herd of cattle brought into the Big Horn
Basin. Later came Capt. Henry Belknap, Otto Franc, Col. W. D. Pickett,
and J. M. Carey, all of whom shaped ranches out of virgin territory on
the west side of the Big Horn Basin, immediately adjacent to the mountain
slopes now inside the forest.</p>
<p>From the early eighties the herds increased, and more and more cattle
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
came into the Big Horn Basin. Homesteaders and settlers were &ldquo;squatting&rdquo;
on and taking up large acreages of the best range land, and finally, there was
not enough year-long range for the increased number of livestock. The
advent of the farmer forced drastic changes in livestock operations. Stockmen
were obliged to produce forage crops to carry a part of their herds
through the winter. Eventually it was necessary to increase the production
of forage crops on the land under cultivation, and this led to the development
of irrigation projects, first by the ranchers, and then by the Federal
Government. With water for their lands and constantly improving
transportation facilities, farmers were able to produce such cash crops as
small grain, truck crops, sugar beets, potatoes, and peas.</p>
<p>As this country was further developed and became more heavily populated,
stockmen grazed their livestock in the higher foothills and eventually
in the mountains during summer, depending upon the Big Horn Basin,
which had formerly been used year-long, for winter range. Thus began
the first actual dependence of the community upon territory within the
forest. As irrigation projects developed, the second&mdash;and now perhaps
the most important&mdash;great economic value of the rugged mountains in the
forest became apparent in their capacity to conserve and store water for
summer use in the valleys below.</p>

</div>
<p>The Federal Government recognized the importance of placing the great
mountain wilderness of the West under control, to assure the perpetuity
and proper use of the natural resources. The establishment of the Shoshone
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Forest in 1891 was the first step taken in carrying out this comprehensive
program. The preservation of the natural resources is now assured,
not by the elimination of use of the forage, timber, water, and other
resources of the forest, but rather by the use of all under proper and progressive
management.</p>

<h3 id="c5">PLACES OF ESPECIAL INTEREST</h3>
<p><i>Bliss Creek.</i>&mdash;One of the favorite routes of rustlers in earlier days, leading
to their favorite rendezvous in Jackson Hole, followed Clark Creek at the
head of the South Fork of the Shoshone River. In 1892, a horse thief
named Bliss, attempting to escape pursuers, was captured by a posse after a
long and grueling chase. He was shot and buried at a point about a mile
above Clark Creek, near where a small stream from the north empties into
the South Fork. This stream was named Bliss Creek as a result of this episode.
Bliss&rsquo;s grave was marked by a rude pile of stones along the trail until
a very few years ago when it was destroyed by a mountain cloudburst.
Bliss Creek can be reached only with a saddle horse and is 35 miles southwest
of Valley.</p>
<p><i>Beartooth Plateau.</i>&mdash;After two military expeditions had previously failed,
the first official crossing of Beartooth Plateau was accomplished during the
last week of August 1882 by a scouting party headed by Lt. Gen. P. H.
Sheridan. In his party were 71 officers, soldiers, and civilians, 36 packers,
1 hunter, and 5 Shoshone Indian scouts and 1 Squaw. The party reached
Cooke City, Mont., on August 24 from Mammoth Hot Springs, and Billings
on August 31. The route selected and followed by General Sheridan was
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
almost identical with that of the present Red Lodge-Cooke City Highway.</p>
<p><i>Dead Indian Hill.</i>&mdash;A small war party of Bannocks was attacked by
General Miles&rsquo; troops just south of Clark, near the northeast corner of the
forest, in 1878, shortly after the Nez Perce outbreak. The Indians retreated
over what is now known as Dead Indian Hill, about 16 miles southwest of
Clark, leaving one of their wounded behind. The following day the
Bannock was found by some of the Crow Indian Army scouts, who promptly
killed and scalped him. Until recent years a rude pile of stones halfway
down the west side of the hill, north of the road and near the drift fence,
marked the grave. From this episode the hill got its name. Captain
Bennett, in charge of the cavalry troop which engaged the Bannocks, and
one of his Crow scouts, Little Rock, lost their lives in the fight. Two
streams running down the east face of Beartooth Plateau, just west of Clark,
bear the names of these men.</p>
<p><i>Camp Monaco.</i>&mdash;Located about 15 miles north of Pahaska Tepee, along
the North Fork of the Shoshone River, is one of the old hunting camps of
Colonel Cody, Camp Monaco. Here in September 1913, Colonel Cody
took as his guests on a hunting trip, Albert I, Prince of Monaco, and his
aide-de-camp, Count Beret. At the close of the successful hunt, the Prince
had his artist paint on a large tree at the camp site, &ldquo;Camp Monaco,
1913,&rdquo; and a bear&rsquo;s foot.</p>

</div>
<p><i>Frank Hammitt Grave.</i>&mdash;Frank Hammitt was one of the first six forest
rangers appointed in the United States. He met his death by plunging
over the precipitous walls of Russell Creek Canyon near its mouth, on
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
July 25, 1903. His grave is near the south base of Antelope Mountain,
beside the Crandall Road. Hammitt was trained for the priesthood, but
gave it up for the life of a cowboy. For 7 years he was chief of cowboys
with Colonel Cody&rsquo;s Wild West Show before he became a forest ranger.</p>
<p><i>Jack Crandall Grave.</i>&mdash;On July 1, 1870, a prospector named Jack Crandall
and his partner, T. Dougherty, were on their way to a rendezvous with
some miner friends on the headwaters of the Clarks Fork River. The
two men made camp on Crandall Creek and, as they prepared their evening
meal, were killed by a marauding band of Indians. The miners&rsquo; picks
were driven into the ground and their severed heads were spitted on the
ends protruding. The grave of these men is marked by a huge boulder on
which is a large bronze plate giving a brief history of the incident. It is
located on the north side of Crandall Creek, about three-fourths of a mile
upstream from the Crandall Creek bridge, on the Sunlight-Clarks Fork
Road.</p>
<p><i>Pahaska Tepee.</i>&mdash;Pahaska Tepee, situated alongside the Cody-Yellowstone
Highway, 51 miles west of Cody, is the original hunting lodge of Colonel
Cody, which he built in 1901. Here he entertained such distinguished
guests as Albert I, Prince of Monaco, statesmen, and the more famous
members of his troup.</p>
<p><i>Sheepeaters&rsquo; Tepees.</i>&mdash;Ancient tepees of the &ldquo;Sheepeaters&rdquo; made entirely
of poles are to be found in different parts of the forest. There is a group
of three, well preserved, on Tepee Creek, a tributary of the North Fork of
Crandall Creek, where the trail crosses. Another is located about 1 mile
above the Timber Creek Ranger Station, along an old logging road. They
can be reached only with saddle horses.</p>
<p><i>The Old Stockade.</i>&mdash;In August of 1891, a cowboy discovered a log stockade
on Beartooth Plateau, on the divide between Little Rock and Bennett
Creeks, about 3 miles north of Deep Lake. The stockade, resembling a
corral about 50 feet in diameter, had been made of huge logs laid up similarly
to those in a log house. Here and there along the walls loopholes
had been cut, obviously to permit shooting through them. The stockade
was old when found. Who it was built by and why is not known. The
logs had been cut with a sort of an ax or a hatchet, yet only a portion of
the work appeared to be that of white men. Some of the chopping
appeared to have been done by a man familiar with the use of an ax,
while other logs were literally &ldquo;gnawed off.&rdquo; The old stockade is still
standing. It can be reached only afoot or with horses.</p>
<p><i>Wapiti Ranger Station.</i>&mdash;The Wapiti Ranger Station, situated along the
Cody-Yellowstone Highway, 30 miles west of Cody, is the oldest ranger
station in the United States built with Government funds. It was erected
in 1901.</p>

</div>
<p><i>The Firefighters Memorial.</i>&mdash;On August 21, 1937, 15 men lost their lives
in what is known as the Blackwater Fire. Along the Cody-Yellowstone
Highway, 36 miles west of Cody, at the mouth of Blackwater Creek, a
large cut stone monument has been constructed by the Forest Service and the
Civilian Conservation Corps, to commemorate the memory of these men.
The fire, which originated 4 miles south of the memorial, burned over 1,254
acres. The Memorial Trail, a splendid foot or horse trail, begins at the
Firefighters Monument and leads to the burned-over area and to Clayton
Gulch, located 6 miles south, where a stone marker with a huge bronze
placque has been constructed to mark the site where Ranger Alfred G.
Clayton, Foreman James T. Saban, Assistant to Technician Rex Hale, and
four Civilian Conservation Corps enrollees&mdash;Rodgers, Gerdes, Griffith,
and Mayabb&mdash;were burned to death. In addition, Junior Forester Paul
E. Tyrrel, Billy Lea, a workman on a Bureau of Public Roads crew, and
CCC enrollees Allen, Garaza, Bevens, Seelke, Sherry, and Whitlock died
as a result of burns suffered on this fire.</p>
<p>Upon the recommendation of the Forest Service, the United States Board
of Geographic Names has changed the name of Double Mountain, which
is the highest point in the vicinity of the Blackwater area, to Clayton
Mountain, in honor of Ranger Clayton. A lookout tower is being constructed
on Clayton Mountain, which commands a view of a considerable
area of the Shoshone National Forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<h3 id="c6">TIMBER&mdash;WATER&mdash;FORAGE</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Timber Resources.</span>&mdash;The actual forested areas within the Shoshone
extend in altitudinal range from about 6,000 to 10,000 feet above sea level.
Below the lower limits of the typical forest areas is a scattering tree growth
of aspen and cottonwoods, restricted principally to the stream courses.</p>
<p>It is estimated that approximately 48 percent of the net area of the
forest is covered with timber, and supports a stand of some 2&frac14; billion
board feet. Lodgepole pine, Douglas fir, and Engelmann spruce are the
principal timber species; alpine fir, Rocky Mountain red cedar, and several
minor broadleaved species also occur.</p>
<p>Mature timber may be purchased, and when sales are made the cut is so
regulated that a perpetual supply of timber will be available without
destroying the forest cover. There are more than 20 different timber operations
within the forest which provide lumber, posts, poles, and other timber
products for the communities and residents of the Big Horn Basin and adjacent
territory, and provide a living for approximately 100 families. These
operations also supply such special products as railroad ties and mine timbers
and props. Hundreds of ranchers and farmers obtain directly such material
as corral poles, fence posts, and fuel from the forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Water Resources.</span>&mdash;The vast coniferous forests of the Shoshone are
important as a ground cover in regulating the flow of streams having their
headwaters inside its boundaries. By retarding the run-off from melting
snows and rains, the forests help to prevent erosion and floods in the spring
and conserve the flow of water through the summer when it can be used for
irrigation. The development of agriculture and, in fact, the future growth
of Wyoming and other Western States are absolutely dependent upon irrigation
water. Two large irrigation projects, the Shoshone and Sunshine,
are dependent upon the forest watersheds, as are many cooperative and
individual users. Without doubt the greatest social and economic contribution
of the forest to those living within and adjacent to it, and the State
at large, is water for irrigation and domestic use.</p>
<p>The Shoshone project waters 73,000 acres, on which agricultural crops
having a value of approximately $2,000,000 are raised annually. With
the completion of the Hart Mountain Division of this project, the area
under water will be increased by approximately 41,000 acres. Local
enterprise in the form of cooperative and individual projects has brought
under irrigation more than 60,000 acres additional. The Sunshine project
provides supplemental water for a part of the land included in the last figure
given. If the Shoshone project is developed to capacity, it is estimated
that approximately 163,000 acres of land will be under water.</p>
<p>There are over a million acres of arid lands in the plains of the Big Horn
and Yellowstone Basins, with favorable soils and potential farm values if
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
water can be made available for irrigation. It is important to conserve
the forest and forage cover so that the greatest volume of usable water
may be available for agricultural use. The future prosperity and agricultural
development of the region is limited to a great extent by the amount
of water that can be supplied for irrigation from the streams having their
sources within the Shoshone Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Grazing Resources.</span>&mdash;The raising of livestock is a basic industry in
Wyoming. The Shoshone provides summer range for 10,000 cattle and
horses, and 75,000 sheep, owned by almost 200 resident owners. The
higher ranges are particularly good for the production of lambs and wool,
and the lower ones are excellent for beef. Range is also furnished for
horse herds of the dude ranchers and for dairy cattle.</p>
<p>Permittees grazing livestock in the national forest are assigned specific
grazing allotments, and are required to handle their stock according to
approved management practices. Local officers endeavor to stock all
ranges conservatively for the purpose of preventing range deterioration
which reduces the volume of forage produced and starts erosion.</p>
<p>Grazing permittees are selected on the basis of ownership of improved
ranch property which is dependent upon forest range to make it an economic
unit. This policy favors the established tax-paying citizen and
eliminates the tramp stockman who has no base of operations but exploits
the country through which he passes.</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that all ranges adapted to the grazing of livestock
have been fully stocked for many years, sufficient forage is reserved to
take care of the 3,500 elk, 6,200 mule deer, 750 antelope, 700 mountain
sheep, and 250 moose which inhabit the forest.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c7">RECREATIONAL USE AND VALUES</h3>
<p>No single activity of the forest has grown so rapidly in recent years as
recreation. The forest is ideally adapted to recreational use because of
the rough, majestic, and undeveloped character of its wilderness where
most travel must be done with a horse and pack outfit. It is truly a forest
with a &ldquo;back country.&rdquo; The numerous lakes and mountain streams, the
glaciers, the vast forest cover, and the abundance of fish and game are
attractions that draw large numbers of people who wish to see wilderness
areas unspoiled by the hand of man.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p><span class="sc">Wilderness Areas.</span>&mdash;Two wilderness areas&mdash;the North Absaroka, containing
about 380,000 acres, and the South Absaroka, containing about
600,000 acres&mdash;have been set aside to insure the perpetuation of the delightful
natural and virgin conditions characteristic of the back country
in the Shoshone. Entirely undeveloped, except for horse trails and occasional
sanitation facilities at camp sites, primeval conditions are comparable
to those encountered when John Colter traveled through this country in
the early years of the nineteenth century. No roads will be permitted nor
will there be any hotels, resorts, or summer homes. Sales of timber will
not be made, but the grazing of domestic stock&mdash;cattle, horses, and sheep&mdash;will
be allowed under well-regulated conditions, insuring ample range for
big game animals and the protection of the basic soil and water resources.</p>
<p>These wilderness areas and the wildlife and fishing resources of the forest
are the basis for one of northwestern Wyoming&rsquo;s principal industries&mdash;dude
ranching. Within and adjacent to the Shoshone are more than 30
such ranches and similar resorts. Guests enjoy all of the sports common in
the mountains&mdash;fishing, hunting, hiking, or riding delightful trails. As
the cool of the evening descends, they enjoy sitting before a glowing campfire
to hear yarns of the West. These ranches and resorts have various
types of accommodations for overnight or weekend guests, camping parties,
pack trips, or family groups. Hundreds of guests visit them annually, and
go home with tanned faces and a spring in their step.</p>
<p>Within the forest are two main highways which offer splendid scenery
to those who do not have the time or inclination to get into the back
country with horses and pack outfits.</p>
<p><i>Along the North Fork.</i>&mdash;The Cody Road to the Yellowstone National
Park, U. S. 20, winds its way along the banks of the North Fork of the
Shoshone River. The forest boundary is 25 miles west of Cody, and on
the way, such interesting features as DeMaris Hot Springs, extinct geyser
cones and craters, the Shoshone Dam, the tunnels, the Shoshone Cavern
National Monument, and typical western stock and dude ranches and
resorts can be visited. At the boundary the character of the country
changes. The canyon becomes narrower, and here on either side, Signal
Peak and Flag Peak, like the Pillars of Hercules, guard the entrance.
From this point to the east entrance of Yellowstone Park, the distance is
27 miles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Within the forest, the road passes through livestock and game ranges,
heavily timbered watersheds, with active timber sales in progress, and
extensively used recreation areas. Thus the tourist is given an opportunity
to actually see the coordinated activities of a national forest. Watch for
the Laughing Pig, the Camel, the Holy City, the Goose, the Anvil, Henry
Ford, Chimney Rock, the Elephant Head, and other figures carved from
rock by the hand of nature.</p>
<p>Along the way there are a number of dude ranches and resorts where
accommodations may be had, also gasoline stations and stores. At frequent
intervals there are picnic and campgrounds for the use of tourists. These
are:</p>

<p><i>Beartooth Plateau&mdash;Clarks Fork Country.</i>&mdash;The Red Lodge-Cooke City
Highway, a hard-surfaced road, passes through the most spectacular area
in the forest. Leaving Red Lodge, Mont., it follows a southwesterly
course along Rock Creek into the Custer National Forest.</p>
<p>Abruptly the highway leaves the creek and turns up the north slope
of Beartooth Plateau, and over easy grades zigzags its sinuous way into
Wyoming and the Shoshone National Forest and to the very &ldquo;top of the
world.&rdquo; Once on top a breath-taking panorama unexpectedly unfolds
before the astonished traveler. Vision is practically unrestricted in any
direction because the road is well above timberline. To the east lies the
Big Horn Basin, with the Big Horn Mountains in the background; to the
south is the Clarks Fork Valley, Sunlight Basin, and still further south
the North Fork and South Fork valleys of the Shoshone. As far as one
can see, rugged snowcapped mountains pierce the sky. In the west,
Pilot Peak and its Siamese twin, Index Peak, point the way into the heavens.
To the north is a continuation of Beartooth Plateau into the Custer Forest
which contains grasshopper glaciers and the &ldquo;land of the red snows.&rdquo;
Everywhere evidences of glaciation and tremendous expanses of barren
rock are to be seen. Snowbanks are common. Numerous lakes of various
sizes nestle in the pockets of the land. Gradually, as the traveler goes
westward, he descends to timberline, where gnarled, stunted trees carry
on an age-old struggle for existence against the fierce elements of cold
driving snows and terrific winds. Further westward as altitude is lost the
timber becomes taller, until as one nears the Clarks Fork River dense,
thrifty stands are the rule.</p>

<p><i>Sunlight Basin.</i>&mdash;There is also a third road, unimproved, which in good
weather affords a real treat to the auto tourist. It leads from Cody over
Dead Indian Hill into Sunlight Basin and the upper Clarks Fork Valley.
This road is delightfully scenic and connects with the Red Lodge-Cooke
City Highway just below the Nordquist ranch. There are two campgrounds
along this route, one where the road crosses Dead Indian Creek and
the other at the Sunlight Creek crossing. The road leads to excellent fishing
in Dead Indian Creek, Sunlight Creek, the Clarks Fork River, and the
waters on Beartooth Plateau. It is the shortest route to Beartooth Plateau
from Cody.</p>
<h3 id="c8">WILDLIFE OF THE FOREST</h3>
<p><span class="sc">Big Game.</span>&mdash;The Shoshone is the only forest in Wyoming in which all
species of big game native to the State are found, with the exception of the
whitetail deer. These include antelope, mule deer, elk, mountain sheep,
moose, and black and grizzly bear. What may be even more surprising is
that there are open seasons on all species&mdash;deer, elk, and bear under the
regular license; antelope, mountain sheep, and moose under special permit.
Another unusual feature about hunting on the Shoshone is that except for
the southern part of the forest the regular hunting season is 60 days long,
from September 15 to November 15. In addition, there is a spring bear
season from May 1 to June 15, just after the bears come out of hibernation
and their skins are best. State Game and Fish regulations frequently change
from year to year. If you plan to go hunting, post yourself on the current
regulations.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>The Shoshone is a favorite rendezvous for nonresident hunters because
it has the game, and the outfitters and guides. The State laws require that
all nonresident big game hunters hire licensed outfitters and guides to
conduct them.</p>
<p>The Forest Service is deeply concerned with the propagation and protection
of game. This involves not only cooperating with State officers
and enforcing the game laws, but providing game herds with sufficient and
suitable range. Throughout the West the national forests supply most of
the summer range for big game animals except antelope. The Shoshone
Forest is no exception. Most national forests contain sufficient summer
range for present game herds and some increases. However, the situation
regarding winter range is different. Most of the land at the lower elevations
where the game originally wintered is outside the forest. Much of
it has been homesteaded and is in livestock ranches and farms. In many
sections of the West game, especially deer and elk, are faced with the
desperate choice of raiding ranches in the valleys and foothills or starving
in the snowdrifts of the high mountains. In some instances the Forest
Service has been able to provide winter game range by regulating grazing
or eliminating livestock entirely from the ranges. Such an example can
be found on the Shoshone on the Elk Fork, Sweetwater, Horse Creek, and
Grizzly Creek drainages. This area furnishes winter range for the largest
elk herd on the forest, and is reserved especially for it. In addition, several
hundred deer also use this same range.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center">SANITATION AND HEALTH</p>
<p class="revint">1. Mountain streams will not purify themselves in a few
hundred feet. Boil or chlorinate all suspected water.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Burn all paper, old clothing, or rubbish. Bury or place in
pits or receptacles provided all garbage, tin cans, bottles, and
other refuse.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Do not wash soiled clothing or utensils or bathe in springs,
streams, or lakes. Use a container and throw dirty water
where it cannot get into the water supply without first
filtering through the ground.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Use the sanitation facilities provided by the Forest Service on
campgrounds and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="revint">5. Observe the rules of sanitation and protect yourself and
others. Report all insanitary conditions to the nearest
health or forest officer.</p>
<p class="revint">6. Obey the posted &ldquo;Rules for the use of improved campgrounds.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>For the purpose of maintaining and preserving the big game herds within
them, the State has established the Shoshone and Hoodoo State Game
Preserves, where no hunting is permitted.</p>
<p>The Cody-Yellowstone Road passes through the Shoshone Preserve.
During the summer months most of the animals, particularly deer, elk, and
mountain sheep, are in the high country back from the road. Moose,
however, are frequently seen along the river and occasionally deer and bear.
During winter and spring, however, hundreds of deer and elk can be seen
quietly feeding along the road. Mountain sheep are also frequently seen
during these seasons.</p>
<p>Keep your camera loaded when passing through the forest. A shot of a
big bull moose or a graceful deer makes just as good a trophy as a head
or a hide, and the camera season is always open. It requires much more
skill to stalk and shoot game with a camera than with a gun.</p>
<p>If you go hunting be a genuine sportsman by obeying the State laws,
by putting out your smokes and campfires, and by leaving a clean camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p><span class="sc">Fur Bearers.</span>&mdash;In the old days of the fur brigade and trading posts the
area now in the forest furnished its quota of furs, and it still produces
some of the finest. The most valuable and most eagerly sought fur bearer
is the marten. In addition, there are badger, muskrat, ermine, mink, red
fox, coyote, and bobcat. There are also three other species which are
protected, beaver, otter, and wolverine, which is extremely rare.</p>
<p>On the Shoshone the trappers are assigned to individual trapping allotments.
Each man regards the allotment as his, because it is reissued to
him year after year as long as he wishes to hold it and obeys the State
and Federal laws. This system promotes harvesting the fur crop rather
than mining it. In other words, the trapper realizes that he cannot take
all of the animals but must leave a sufficient number to restock the allotment
for future trapping. Each trapper is required to report to the proper officer
all game law violations occurring within his territory.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fishing.</span>&mdash;Practically all suitable waters of the forest are stocked with
fish. Species include the black spotted, rainbow, Eastern brook, and mackinaw
trout, Montana grayling, and whitefish.</p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of keeping lakes and streams stocked
the State Game and Fish Commission operates a fish hatchery near Cody,
and practically all of its output is used in replenishing the waters of the
forest. Additional assistance is rendered by the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries
by furnishing planting stock from its Yellowstone Park, Crawford, Nebr.,
and Bozeman, Mont., hatcheries. Forest officers cooperate with representatives
of these agencies in planting fish in forest waters. The forest maintains
a specially built tank truck for transportation of fish into the mountain
waters. Four rearing ponds have been constructed by the Forest Service
in which fry and fingerling trout are kept until they are from 4 to 7 inches
in length before being released. The percentage of survival of fish reared in
such ponds is many times greater than when they are released in turbulent
mountain streams before they are large enough to care for themselves.</p>
<h3 id="c9">FIRE&mdash;ENEMY OF THE FOREST</h3>
<p>Each forest fire that burns means a loss of forest resources. Timber,
forage, wildlife are destroyed; soil erosion follows; everybody loses. Fires
are always a menace in the summertime and more than half of them occur
because some careless smoker or camper does not take care of his match,
cigarette, pipe, or campfire. From 1909 to the close of 1939, 229 fires, which
burned over 25,649 acres, have occurred. In recent years the Shoshone
National Forest has suffered heavy losses from two large fires and an increasing
number of smaller ones. The Crandall fire in 1935 burned over
12,600 acres. This tremendous and staggering loss was the result of the
carelessness of <i>ONE MAN</i>. In 1937, the tragic Blackwater fire occurred.
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
Although only 1,254 acres of forest were destroyed, the fire resulted in one
of the worst disasters in the history of the Forest Service fire fighting. Fifteen
men, whose memory has been perpetuated in the Firefighters Memorial
paid the supreme sacrifice.</p>
<p>New improvements are being constructed in the never-ending fight to
prevent or quickly control forest fires. Equipment, such as the Bosworth
fire trencher, is being developed. This is a small machine which is guided
by an operator and motored by a marine engine. The motor propels a
series of steel lugs which kick out dirt and debris and speedily clear a fire
trail down to mineral soil. Fire towers, which will make visible a large
part of the forest, are in process of construction or are contemplated. In
addition to the new tower on Clayton Mountain, another is being erected
on Windy Mountain, located about 6 miles south of the Crandall Ranger
Station. This will make visible a large portion of this immense country
in the North Absaroka wilderness, including the area burned in the Crandall
Creek fire of 1935.</p>

<p class="pcap"><span class="small jr">F-385833</span><br /> <i>High ranges produce fat lambs.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Another tower on Clay Butte, near Beartooth Lake, will provide better
protection for the scenic Beartooth Plateau and the Clarks Fork Valley.</p>
<p>When a smoke is spotted, the lookout observer determines the bearing
to the fire and phones this information to a ranger or the forest supervisor
so that action may be taken. If the lookout is uncertain of the stream
valley or other topographical feature by which the fire can be located and
best reached, a cross shot is obtained from another lookout station, if
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
possible. In case of a large fire, an airplane cruise is sometimes made to
observe the progress of the fire and determine the best way of controlling it.</p>
<h3 id="c10">RETURNS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES</h3>
<p>Twenty-five percent of all revenues derived from permitted uses on
national forests is returned to the counties for road and school funds. In
addition, 10 percent of the forest receipts is returned to the forest for the
construction and maintenance of its road and trail system. Actually 35
percent of the gross forest receipts is returned directly and indirectly to the
locality from whence it was collected.</p>
<h3 id="c11">TREES OF THE SHOSHONE</h3>
<p>PINES.&mdash;Pines are conifers distinguished principally by the needles that
are gathered together at the base in bundles of from one to five in a little
sheath that usually wears off after the first year. The cones have woody
scales. There are three pines on the Shoshone.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Limber Pine</span> (<i>Pinus flexilis</i>).&mdash;Needles are fine, almost silky, dark green,
1&frac12; to 3 inches long, always in bundles of five. Cones are 3 to 5 inches
long, with seeds &#8531; inch long; scales smooth. Bark is light gray or silvery
white, except on old trunks, which are blackish brown and furrowed.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Whitebark Pine</span> (<i>Pinus albicaulis</i>).&mdash;Very difficult to distinguish from
limber pine, although needles are more rigid and slightly curved. Needles
are from 1&frac12; to 2&frac12; inches long. Cones are from 1&frac12; to 3 inches long and
of a dark purple color. The bark is chalky-white. This tree is found at
elevations of from 8,500 to 10,000 feet, or slightly above the limber pine.
It is not as important for commercial use as are the other pines.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Lodgepole Pine</span> (<i>Pinus contorta</i>).&mdash;Needles are 1&frac12; to 2 inches long,
yellow-green, growing in bundles of two. Bark is thin. Cones are one-sided,
1&frac12; to 2 inches long, and cling to the branches for years without
opening or dropping their seeds. Cone scales are armed with short spines.
This species is used mostly for railroad ties, mine props, and telephone
poles.</p>
<p>SPRUCES.&mdash;Spruces have sharp-pointed, four-sided needles scattered over
the twigs singly, leaving twigs rough like a grater when they fall off.
There is only one spruce on the Shoshone Forest.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Engelmann Spruce</span> (<i>Picea engelmanni</i>).&mdash;The new-growth twigs are
covered with soft, short hair. Needles are less rigid and less sharply
pointed than those of blue spruce, green, dark blue, or pale steel-blue.
Cones are 1 to 2 inches long. Bark is dark, reddish brown, and separates
in the form of small, rounded scales. Main trunk, in contrast to blue
spruce, is smooth and clean.</p>
<p>FIRS.&mdash;Needles are blunt, flat, and soft to the touch, without any stem
where they join branches. They leave flat, round scars when they fall off
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
in contrast to short stubs left by spruce on twigs. Cones, unlike those of
other species, stand erect. In the fall, the cones fall to pieces and leave
only spikes on the branch. Buds are blunt and pitchy. Blisters, containing
liquid pitch or balsam, are scattered over the smooth bark.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Alpine Fir</span> (<i>Abies lasiocarpa</i>).&mdash;Leaves are flat, 1 to 1&frac34; inch long,
without any stem where they join the branches. Needles tend to turn
upward. Cones are 2&frac12; to 4 inches long, dark purple. The bark is gray
and smooth, except in older parts of the tree where it is broken into ridges.
Tree has a sharp, spirelike crown. It usually grows mixed with Engelmann
spruce.</p>
<p>DOUGLAS FIR (<i>Pseudotsuga taxifolia</i>).&mdash;Although similar in name, this
species has no direct relationship to the true fir. Its leaves are flat, &frac34; to
1&frac12; inches long, with short stems that join them to the branches. Cones
are pendent, with three-pronged bracts protruding from the cone scales;
they are persistent and fall off the tree whole. Buds are sharp-pointed,
shiny, smooth, red brown.</p>
<p>CEDARS.&mdash;<span class="sc">Rocky Mountain Red Cedar</span> (<i>Juniperus scopulorum</i>).&mdash;The
berries are about the size of peas, the bark is scaly, the twigs are slender
and graceful, and the heartwood is red. The species is distinguished from
the one-seed juniper in that its berry usually has two seeds and is bluish
or black. The berries mature in 2 years.</p>
<p>BROADLEAF TREES.&mdash;<span class="sc">Aspen</span> (<i>Populus tremuloides</i>).&mdash;Aspens are commonly
called &ldquo;quaking aspens&rdquo; or &ldquo;quakers.&rdquo; The flat, nearly heart-shaped
leaves are about 2 inches across; they tremble characteristically in
a breeze. The bark is whitish or very pale green, smooth with black
scars where branches have dropped off. The trees rarely grow more than
50 feet high.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Narrowleaf Cottonwood</span> (<i>Populus augustifolia</i>).&mdash;This is usually a tall
tree, 40 to 60 feet high. The bark is dark gray, heavily ridged half or two-thirds
of the way up the tree; above that, smooth and pale green. The
leaves are &frac12; inch to 1 inch wide by 2 or 3 inches long, very similar to
willow leaves. The species is usually found along streams at lower
elevations.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Alder</span> (<i>Alnus tenuifolia</i>).&mdash;The alder grows along and overhanging the
streams, usually in clumps, several trees from the same root, frequently 4 to
6 inches in diameter and 15 to 25 feet high. Its leaves are large and sharply
double toothed. The mature, seed-bearing fruit is conelike and noticeable
in winter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Rocky Mountain Maple</span> (<i>Acer glabrum</i>).&mdash;Usually a shrub, but frequently
20 to 30 feet high, this species has paired opposite buds, sharply lobed
leaves, light-gray bark, and paired, winged seed. Its leaves are 1 to 2
inches long, opposite each other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p><span class="sc">Willows</span> (<i>Salix sp.</i>).&mdash;The common shrub of creek bottoms. Leaves are
usually narrow and sharp-pointed. Some willows attain a diameter of 4
inches and a height of 15 to 25 feet. The buds are covered by a single
scale.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pacific Serviceberry</span> (<i>Amelanchier florida</i>).&mdash;Leaves silvery, sharply
toothed toward the end, and alternate on branches. Trees, or more often
shrubs, 6 to 15 feet high. Flowers white and in clusters. Five hard seeds
in each berry.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Western Chokecherry</span> (<i>Prunus demissa</i>).&mdash;This is a shrub, 3 to 15 feet
high. Flowers and fruit clustered. Alternate leaves are sharply pointed.
Bark, leaves, and seed are bitter. Fruit is black.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="center">RULES FOR FIRE PREVENTION</p>
<p class="revint">1. Be sure your match is out. Break it in two before you throw
it away.</p>
<p class="revint">2. Be sure that pipe ashes and cigar or cigarette stubs are dead
before throwing them away. Never throw them into brush,
leaves, or needles. Don&rsquo;t smoke while traveling through the
woods.</p>
<p class="revint">3. Use fire grates at improved campgrounds and observe the
rules for building and extinguishing fires. Before building a
campfire at places where no grates are available, scrape away
all inflammable material from a place about 4 feet in diameter.
Keep your fire small and never build it against trees or logs,
or near brush.</p>
<p class="revint">4. Never break camp until your fire is out, dead out.</p>
<p class="revint">5. Stir the coals while soaking them with water, turn burned
sticks and drench both sides. Wet the ground around the fire
and be sure the last spark is dead.</p>
<p class="revint">6. Never burn slash or brush in windy weather or while there is
the slightest danger that the fire will get away.</p>
<p>IF YOU FIND A FOREST FIRE, put it out if you can. If you
cannot put it out, report it to the forest supervisor, the ranger,
the sheriff, or the nearest telephone operator. Location of the
headquarters of the supervisor and the rangers is indicated on
the map.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
